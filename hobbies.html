<h2 id="header-2">Using uMap and Open Street Map to map shops that makes deliveries due to COVID-19 pandemic</h2> 
During a pandemic as the one we're in, it could be useful for people who cannot or would not move to know which shops make deliveries. This <a href="http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/it/map/mappa-degli-esercizi-che-effettuano-consegne-a-dom_434220"> map</a> was created for my own place, <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gubbio">Gubbio</a>, in the middle and center of Italy and it started as a "supermarket list" but you can never know what a "list" means to a geographer! I took my inspiration from my colleague and friend <a href="https://ilsarrett.wordpress.com/">Alessandro Sarretta</a> (<a href="https://ilsarrett.wordpress.com/2020/03/22/consegne-a-domicilio-per-persone-in-difficolta-durante-lemergenza-covid-19-creare-una-mappa-con-umap-e-dati-openstreetmap/">here</a>) and I found that helping people while contributing to a broader Open Source project like <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">Open Street Map</a> was a huge opportunity for me and the community I live in.
